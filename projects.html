        <div class ="Nightscout">
            <a href="https://katelynmhopper.github.io/nightscout/" class="cgm">Type 1 Diabetes Tracking Website</a>
            <p>For this personal project I wanted to copy a nightscout site that allows me to basically set up a DIY "loop" algorithm for managing your blood sugars. While my site is far from being as in depth as the nightscout site I was able to access all of my data and have it display. It shows my current glucose, the trend direction and the change.</p>

            <div class="Shopping">
            <a href="https://katelynmhopper.github.io/Shopping-Cart/" class="cart">Shopping Cart Project</a>
            <p>In this project I created a interactive shopping cart. You can add items to your cart which will remove the item from inventory, it updates your total and you can remove items you no longer want. With the use of an Amazon AWS database you can reload the store when you run it locally. If you want to try it out head over to the git repo where you can clone the code and create your own. </p>

        <div class="Bank">
            <a href="https://katelyn-hopperfullbankingapplication.netlify.app" class="bad">Three Tier Bank Website</a>
         
            <p>This project is a banking application that doesn't have any security implemented ( hence a bad bank). You can create an account, login, deposit, withdraw, and check your balance. You can click on the link to see the site in action or for more accessibility and control head to the repo where you can clone all the files and get started.</p>

        <div class="Ground">
            <a href="https://katelynmhopper.github.io/Ground-School-Single-Page-App/#" class="ground">Ground School App</a>
            <p>This is a single page application that is a mock up of a pilot ground school training page. Not all the content was filled in but all the functionality has been added. You can click the link and clone the repo to play around on your own.</p>

        <div class="PacMan">
            <a href=https://katelynmhopper.github.io/PacMan/ class="man">PacMan Game</a>
            
            <p>This project I created a PacMen factory where you can click a button to add as many new PacMen as you want. After that you can start movement where they will move randomly through out the screen and will bounce off all the edges. If you want to try it out you can see the project in the browser by clicking on the image or click on the link to find the code so you can create your own.</p>

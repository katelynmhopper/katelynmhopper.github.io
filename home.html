            <h1>My Background</h1>
            <p> I was working as a Demand Planner for Traeger Grills when I was introduced to SQL and the world of coding. Originally my career plan was to be a pilot which is why I majored in Avaition Science. After some unexpected medical road blocks I have decided to no longer pursue this as a career. After learning how to use SQL it peaked my interest in web development and learning how to code. I decided that I wanted  to pursue this as a career so I enrolled in the MIT Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN - MIT xPRO. Since then I have been working to build as much experience and continue learning. I am currently a contract Web Developer working with Inventive where I have been using Cascade as well as JS, NextJS and Prismic</p>

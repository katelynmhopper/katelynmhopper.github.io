    <h2> BIO </h2> 
    <p>My background is in aviation. I have a bachelor's degree from Utah Valley University in Aviation Science. Due to medical issues that came up while time building towards an airline job I am no longer pursuing aviation as a career. Since then I have bounced around a little bit as I searched for a new career. I currently work as a demand planner. I have always had an intrest in coding and how it all worked so after taking a career aptitude test with web development being my top match I decided to give it a try. I have been completing the MIT certificate and have loved every step so far. It's been one of the most challenging things I have ever done but I can't wait to learn more.</p>

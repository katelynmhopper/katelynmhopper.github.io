            <h1>A little more about me...</h1>
            <p> I am currently working as a demand planner while I grow my experience in full stack development. I am enrolled in the MITxPRO, Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN to start building on the SQL and redshift knowledge I gained as a demand planner. 
            </br>
                Outside of pursuing a new career in full stack development I fly airplanes, I am a mom to a wild toddler, we have 3 Australian shepherds and I have type 1 diabetes. To top it off my husband is a police officer so there is nothing boring about our life. 
             </br>
                From managing diabetes to flying airplanes I have developed a diverse range of skills to keep up with my crazy life. I have learned to multi-task, prioritize and manage my time. I also have developed a great deal of patience negotiating with an independent toddler and strengthened my communication skills teaching Chinese students how to fly airplanes.

            <h3> A Little About Me </h3>
            <p> I am currently seeking a position where I can utilize my skills as a junior developer. I have mainly worked with the MERN stack using javascript. I have experience with SQL, Docker, React, Postman, Express, MongoDB, CSS, HTML, Magento, and Node. 
            </br> 
                Outside of pursuing a new career in full stack development I fly airplanes, I am a mom to a wild toddler, we have 3 Australian shepherds and I have type 1 diabetes. To top it off my husband is a police officer so there is nothing boring about our life. 
            </br>
                From managing diabetes to flying airplanes I have developed a diverse range of skills to keep up with my crazy life. I have learned to multi-task, prioritize and manage my time. I also have developed a great deal of patience negotiating with an independent toddler and strengthened my communication skills teaching Chinese students how to fly airplanes. 
             </br>
